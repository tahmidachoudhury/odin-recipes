    <h1>Stir-Fried Spiced Shredded Potatoes (Aloo Baazi)</h1>

    <p>It may seem pretty <em>boring</em>, it's literally just potatoes fried in a pan.
       However, it is the <em>simplicity</em> that makes it so good. Something that is mellow in 
       spice, not too difficult to make, <i>comforting</i>, <i>soft</i>, and they're potatoes at 
       the end of the day (pretty hard to mess up).
