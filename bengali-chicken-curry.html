    <h1>Chicken Curry (murgi tarkhari)</h1>
    <p>Do you want to <i>learn</i> how to make a traditional, rustic,
       authentic Chicken Curry from your dusty run-down council estate kitchen? 
    </p>
    <p><b>Say no more.</b></p>
    <p>Now don't be offended by my remarks on your finances or state of your kitchen, 
        because it is actually surprisingly relevant.
        Traditionally, these curries are made in thin, metal pots on top of coal and burning 
        wood, which isn't too far off from what the Hillingdon, Ealing or Tower Hamlets 
        councils provide - which is <b>great!</b> We can get started straight away.
