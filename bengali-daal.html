    <p>Maybe you came to this page looking for a vegetarian dish.
        Or maybe you know how to make Daal but just want to know how the 
        bengali's do it. Or <i>maybe</i>, just <i>maybe</i> you came here
        to try a new recipe because the chicken curry was <em>sooo</em>

    <img class="pic-size" src="./images/bengali-masoor-dal-recipe.jpg">
    <p>A <i>classic</i> staple dish in asian cuisine in general. Everyone's kind of
        got their own twists and versions of <b>Dhaal</b>, you may see that Indians
        have it at a thicker consistency or maybe they use a variety of lentils.. 
        Nonetheless, this recipe is still an undisputed classic comfort food.
