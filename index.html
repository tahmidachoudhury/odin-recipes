                <h1>Traditional Bengali Recipes for <i>coconuts</i></h1>
                <h4>(<i>My mum taught me these</i>)</h4>           
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Living in the west, we most times are disconnected from cultural foods and, 
                        if you are unfortunate enough, return home after a long day to microwaved meals
                        and the infamous <b>beans on toast</b>... <i>Yikes</i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Myself however, a fellow coconutee, am here to save you from that dread 
                        no matter what situation you find yourself to be in. Whether you live with
                        your family, or by yourself, or with a spouse - you can now enjoy these three
                        bengali home-cooked meals and stink up the home with some good-old <i>haldi, maris, 
                        zeera</i> and <i>daniya</i>! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These meals <i>should</i> be relatively simple, and have been passed down 
                        to me through my mum who learnt from her mum who learnt from her mum who learnt
                        from... so on and so forth. Feel free to adjust the spice level if you need but 
                        honestly these recipes aren't really that spicy.
